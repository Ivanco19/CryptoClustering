# Cryptocurrency Clustering Project

### Overview
This project revolves around the analysis of a cryptocurrency dataset, which provides periodic information about the value of various cryptocurrencies over different time intervals (24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year). The primary objective was to employ the KMeans clustering algorithm to uncover underlying patterns in the data.

### Methodology
Determining Optimal Clusters using Elbow Method:

1. The analysis began by utilizing the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters. After careful evaluation, it was identified that 4 clusters was deemed as the ideal number.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Analysis:
2. Additionally, the project explored the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess the dimensionality of the dataset. Surprisingly, the PCA analysis revealed that a mere 2 clusters were sufficient to capture the essential patterns in the data.

### Findings
Elbow Method Results:

1. The Elbow Method indicated that the cryptocurrency data could be effectively grouped into 4 distinct clusters, providing insights into potential market segmentation.
PCA Analysis Insights:
2. Contrary to the Elbow Method, PCA suggested that a reduced number of clusters (2 clusters) could adequately represent the inherent structure of the cryptocurrency dataset.

### Conclusion
This project showcases the versatility of clustering techniques, with the Elbow Method and PCA offering differing perspectives on the optimal number of clusters for the cryptocurrency dataset. The findings provide valuable insights into potential market dynamics and clustering patterns within the cryptocurrency space.
